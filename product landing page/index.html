                We are a group of people with decades of experience in growing and
               selling apples. We know what a good apple looks like and how they
               are grown. This essential fruit requires a temperate climate, loamy
               soil that is rich in organic matter apart from needing proper
               drainage and aeration facilities. Lucky for us we live in Kashmir
               which is proudly known as paradise of earth is also home to
               temperate fruits like apple for which the state is very famous
               across globe. The main factor which influence temperate fruit
               bearing trees is soil, climate and environment which are highly
               favorable and unparalleled in the province of Kashmir. Kashmiri
               apples a unique look, taste, flavor, size and color
